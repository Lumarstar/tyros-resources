# Lesson X - Where to from here?

## Introduction
Congratulations on making it to the end!

Of course, we've only just barely scratched the surface of the magical world of programming. We hope your journey of learning doesn't stop here — there's still an endless number of concepts to explore.

We've compiled a list of topics you should continue exploring to become a seasoned Python programmer, and some great resources you can use.

## How you can use Python in real life
Skills are only useful if they can be applied in your everyday life. We're firm believers in the principle that theory should be taught in tandem with application.

You may have noticed that many of our example code and practice questions were designed with real-world scenarios in mind, like when wrote code to calculate income taxes and interests. We hope you can take our lead from these examples and write your own programmes to solve problems in your life.

## Where to go from here?
To guide you in your quest, here's a list of search terms for Python concepts you can explore. These are all foundational ideas in computer science, and we've ranked them according to their level of complexity.

* Functions
* Data structures: Lists, tuples, dictionaries
* Reading files
* Error handling
* Object-oriented programming: Classes, methods, attributes
* Modules, packages

Here's a list of websites you can use to help in your learning.

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com): Useful references and tutorials
* [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com), [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com), and other websites with guided Python courses, many of which are free.
* [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/): A subreddit for Python Q&a for beginners.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com): A Q&A site for when you're more experienced.

You might have noticed a *Further reading* section at the bottom of most of our notes. They're a great starting point to learning more about each week's lesson.

Our favourite way to learn Python (or any skill, for that matter) is through projects. It's how many of us personally got familiar with coding, because you get to experiment and problem-solve with a specific goal in mind. [Here are some projects that you can try for yourself!](https://hackr.io/blog/python-projects)

As you get even more familiar with Python, you'll be itching to expand your horizons, and become a fully-fledged software developer. As you start to spread your wings, come back here to this page once in a while for a rough roadmap of where you should go beyond Python. You'll discover that once you've learned one language, the same exact concepts carry over to any other language — you'll only take a few days to master a new language.

* Frontend web languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Backend web languages, like PHP, Node.js, and Python
* Version control systems, like Git
* App development languages, like Java, Dart, and Swift
* Robotics languages, like C, C++, and Python
* Machine learning and AI, using tools like TensorFlow

Of course, we hope you pick up skills beyond just languages and syntax. As you become an experienced coder, these skills will help you not only write better code, but be a better problem-solver.

* How to effectively Google for help
* How to break down complex tasks
* How to abstractionalise patterns
* How to design and structure algorithms
* How to collaborate with others
* How to read (and write) documentation

## Signing off
You're well on your way in your journey to becoming an experienced programmer. It's been an incredible few weeks, and though we'd all like it to continue, this is as far as we can take you. We hope you had fun, and learned a little something.

The world of computer science is filled with intrigue, amazement, and frustration. Our goal has been to give you a taste of Python, to equip you with the skills and interest you need to continue exploring yourself. If we've inspired you to continue learning Python on your own, we've accomplished our goal.

We wish you luck on your journey, in the hopes that some day you'll join us in this community of coders, developers, tinkerers, artists, and problem-solvers.

Until we meet again.

With ❤️, Tianshi, En Hao, Souw Chuan, Brian, and Zenwei.
