# Lesson X - Where to go from here

## Introduction

Congratulations on making it this far! It has been an incredible 5 lessons thus far and we have come to the end of our course. However, we hope that your journey in learning programming does not stop here. Thus, we have compiled a list of resources where you can continue learning Python on your own, and showcase some applications of Python!

## Where do we go from here?

In our course, we have taught you only the very basics of Python. In fact, there is so much more to it, way more than we could ever consolidate for you. You can drop by [this website](https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/guides/learn-python-free/) to find some of the best free bootcamps on Python online!

Still, one of the best ways to learn Python is through projects. In this way, you get to experiment with how Python works with a specific goal in mind. [Here are some projects that you can try for yourself](https://hackr.io/blog/python-projects)!

## How about applying Python...
Python has far reaching applications in our daily lives! We can use it in web development (things to do with websites), data science, or even in Artificial Intelligence! [Here iS Geek for Geeks' Top 10 applications of Python.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-python-applications-in-real-world/)

## Conclusion
As short as this final lesson is, we hope that you will continue to explore programmming on your own! Thank you so much for staying with us through the duration of this course.
