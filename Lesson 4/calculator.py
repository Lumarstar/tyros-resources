# I want to do math with Python! Help me make a calculator that is able to add,
# subtract, multiply and divide.

# Your programme should first display a menu that looks like this:

# ```
# 0: Quit
# 1: Add
# 2: Subtract
# 3: Multiply
# 4: Divide

# Choose an option:
# ```

# I will choose an option by typing its number. Your programme should include a
# check to make sure that the number I've typed in is a valid option. If it
# isn't, the programme should prompt me to try again.

# Then, your programme should ask me for two numbers. It will then perform the
# operation, and display the number.

# Afterwards, it should show me the original menu again, so I can make as many
# operations as I want.
