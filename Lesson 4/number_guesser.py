# Let's play a number guessing game. The user will think of a number between 1
# and 10. A Python programme will guess the number and ask if it's right or
# wrong. If the guess is wrong, the programme will guess again. If the guess is
# right, the game will finish, and the programme will display the number of
# rounds it's taken to guess the number correctly.
